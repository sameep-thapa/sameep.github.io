            I have created my web page just like this webpage it is very simple and cool and the detailing in this web page is simple. when we move the mouse pointer over the book. it somehow becomes bigger and this web page contains the small detailing and the book containg the detail about the price is also better.
            this detailed description of the book and the book price is so better and easily. People who have accessed to this webpage can easily get the detail about the book they dont need to get to other for knowing the book price.

            From this web page we can see how the form is made. I have taken the idea of the form writting from this web page where we can contact to this webpage company for buying book and the idea is great and so useful the wrong validation of the data will not be acceptable by the form or the webpage.
